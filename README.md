The Azerbaijani Language News Analysis System was developed to analyze news content in Azerbaijani, with the goal of providing a comprehensive understanding of the sentiment and topics expressed in the news. The project involved several key steps, including gathering, cleaning, and labeling text data for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and category classification.

To begin, a large dataset of Azerbaijani news articles was compiled from various online sources. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed to remove any unnecessary characters, punctuation, and special symbols. A specific stopwords dataset was used to eliminate common words like "the," "and," and "a" that do not carry significant meaning in the context of the news articles.

Next, a range of preprocessing techniques were applied to the text data, including stemming and stopword removal. Stemming involves reducing words to their base or root form, which helps to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis. Stopword removal, on the other hand, involves removing common words that do not carry significant meaning in the context of the news articles.

Once the data was preprocessed, it was used to train machine learning models for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and category classification. Sentiment analysis involves identifying the emotional tone or attitude conveyed by a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. Topic modeling involves identifying the underlying topics or themes that are present in a set of texts, such as politics, economy, or sports. Category classification involves assigning a text to a specific category or class.


A web scraping system was also developed as part of the project, allowing users to input news links and retrieve the corresponding text data. This system was designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a simple interface that allows users to input the URL of the news article and retrieve the analyzed data.

Finally, a web application was designed to display the visual analytics of the analyzed news, providing clear insights into the sentiment and topics expressed in the news. The application includes a range of visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds, that allow users to quickly and easily understand the results of the analysis.

Overall, the Azerbaijani Language News Analysis System is a powerful tool for analyzing news content in Azerbaijani, providing valuable insights into the sentiment and topics expressed in the news. It has the potential to be used by a wide range of stakeholders, including news organizations, researchers, and policymakers, to better understand the news and make more informed decisions.
